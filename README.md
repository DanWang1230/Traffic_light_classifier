# Traffic_light_classifier

This classification algorithm uses computer vision techiniques to classify traffic light images (red, yellow, green).

The pipeline is as follows:
* pre-processing these images
* extracting features that distinguish the different types of images
* using those features to classify the traffic light images into three classes: red, yellow, or green
